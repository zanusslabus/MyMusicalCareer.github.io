How did I became a musician, or should I say: "Do you want to become a musician"?
</h3>
<p style="text-align:center;">
If you want to become a musician, you must first enroll to music school and pick a instrument that you wanna play. There you will learn the basics an theory of music and you will then be able to understand your instrument. One of the music schools you can enroll in is: <a href="https://www.gsidrija.si/">Music school in Idrija</a>.

How to play the trumpet?
</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;">
When playing the trumpet, the player blows air into the mouthpiece, creating a buzzing sound. The vibration of the lips creates sound waves that travel through the leadpipe and into the main tubing. By pressing the valves, the player changes the length of the tubing, altering the pitch of the sound. The sound is then amplified and projected through the bell. By combining different valve combinations, fingerings, and techniques such as lip control, tonguing, and breath control, the player can produce a wide range of notes and musical expressions on the trumpet.

<li style="text-align:center;">"Bariton"</li>
<p style="text-align:center;">
After many years of learning music, I taught myself to play the baritone. The baritone is one of the most important instruments in folk music, as well as in brass bands, because it is responsible for the correct rhythm and the basis of the music. It is played in the same way as the trumpet, but with one more valve and a deeper mouthpiece.In the following video, you can recognise it by its sharp sound and large size, and by the way it follows the rhythm of the guitar. In the video it is played by Aleš Jurman, who in my opinion is the best baritone player in folk music. The name of the ensemble in the video is the Saša Avsenika Ensemble and they are the most recognisable folk entertainment ensemble in Slovenia.
