The foundation of the Cerkno Brass Band dates back to 1974, when the Brass Band was founded on the initiative of the management of the successful company ETA.
This revitalised musical and other cultural activities in the town and the surrounding area. The company's generous financial support enabled the purchase of instruments and a fruitful cooperation with the Idrija Music School in Cerkno began, which provided musical education for its future members.
</p>
<p>
The first conductor of the newly founded orchestra was Mr. Ivan Rijavec, who already on 28 November 1974 led the orchestra to its first performance which also marked the official opening of the period of activity of the ETA Cerkno Wind Ensemble. The very next year, the orchestra was taken over by Mr Ivan Marinič, who remained loyal to the Cerkno brass band for 19 years. At the time of its first beginnings, the brass band repertoire consisted mainly of the then very well-known choral music. However, in his quest to find new directions and forms of musical expression, conductor Marinič began to replace them with more modern and challenging concert pieces for wind orchestras.
</p>
<p>The orchestra soon became indispensable at festivals, meetings and openings, and also established contacts with other orchestras, including those outside Slovenia.
In the 1980s and early 1990s, the ETA Wind Orchestra participated in many of the then very trendy competitions of the Inner and Primorje wind orchestras and other wind band festivals. They also took part in three wind band competitions of Slovenia, third level of difficulty. They were awarded the golden plaque of the Association of Cultural Organisations of Slovenia as the best orchestra in the 1988 competition in their group. In 1984 they received the Pirnat Award from the then Assembly of the Idrija Municipality, on the occasion of its 10th anniversary, and on the occasion of its 25th anniversary they received the Bevko Award from the Municipality of Cerkno.

At the very beginning of the brass band, concerts were also held in the surrounding villages (Gorje, Ravne, Šebrelje, etc.), and the concert venues were quite simple. They were even played in a peculiarity of the Slovenian countryside and architecture - a trestle. Later on, the now traditional and annual Spring and Christmas concerts were established in Cerkno. The spring concert, which was held in front of the Hotel Cerkno, and in recent years also in front of the Church of St Anne, has a more pleasant outdoor setting. The Christmas-New Year's concert, however, has always been looking for a more suitable location. The first concert, in 1974, was still held in the old cinema, where the post office is today. Then it was held in the dining room of the so-called "old" Ete, then in the Firemen's Hall and, last but not least, in the hall above the swimming pool. For the last five years, however, the orchestra has chosen the hall of the Cerkno Primary School as the most suitable venue for its concerts on such cold days.When Mr Ivan Marinič ended his long-standing conducting career in 1994, he was succeeded by a young local conductor, Mr Domen Prezelj, who brought a youthful enthusiasm and new ways of working to the orchestra. With a new, more modern selection of compositions, he attracted many young instrumentalists to the brass band and thus rejuvenated it to a large extent.
</p>
<p>
During Prezelj's leadership of the orchestra, the brass band also celebrated its 25th anniversary. On the occasion of this anniversary, the first "Honorary Member of the Brass Band" titles were awarded. These were Mr Rafael Mavri, former General Manager of Eta Cerkno, who has supported the orchestra's activities and development financially and morally since its inception, and Mr Ivan Marinič, who has remained loyal to the orchestra for 19 years and has made a decisive contribution to the fact that the orchestra's activities have not ceased, but are still developing today under the baton of the following conductors.
</p>
<p>
In 2001, Mr Julijan Vidmar took over as conductor, and he was able to correctly assess the abilities of the players and take them further musically. The orchestra became more and more popular among the audience year after year, and the distinguished musical guests whom Julijan Vidmar invited to participate in the concerts also contributed to the mosaic, greatly enriching the concerts with them. During his leadership of the orchestra, a big band was also formed to perform jazz-tinged compositions, but after the conductor's departure from the orchestra, the big band came to an end.
</p>
<p>The Cerkno brass band has collaborated with many well-known musicians, such as organist Miro Božič, Eva Hren of the Katrinas trio, singers Gianni Rijavec and Vladimir Čadež, clarinettist Jože Kotar, Robi Primožič, clarinettist of the Gašperji ensemble, Matjaž Mrak, vocalist of the Štajerskih 7 ensemble, and others. The Cerkno Wind Orchestra has also made its mark in the archives of Radio Television Slovenia. In 1980, RTV Slovenia made a documentary film about Slovenian orchestras, and of course they did not forget about the Cerkno windband players.
</p>
<p>
Andrej Zupan took over the baton in 2004.With his professional knowledge, his exceptional ear for music, his genuine and subtle pedagogical work, and his warm attitude towards the players, he has contributed to the orchestra's remarkable progress and, in cooperation with the players, has developed it to the point where it is now successfully performing in the local environment and beyond. For his efforts, Mr Zupan was also awarded the Bevko Prize of the Municipality of Cerkno for 2010. In 2022, the orchestra was taken over by Uroš Menegatti, a young academic and local resident, who has led the orchestra successfully ever since.
