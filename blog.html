<h2 style="text-align: center;">My best concert</h2>
<p style="text-align:center;">
My best concert was in 2017. With a local orchestra we performed a "ROCK" concert in the centre of Cerkno. The atmosphere was amazing and it was one of my first concerts in front of a really huge crowd. The concert was even more special because I played a trumpet solo in one of the songs. Definitely my favourite concert ever.

<p>- My first brass band gig: At the end of summer 2022, with very good friends and top musicians, we formed the TačMi Brass Band. The band ranges from very young to more experienced musicians. We play from Balkan music, to folk music and also more modern music. In February 2023 we were invited to participate in one of the biggest Slovenian carnivals "Lavfarija". We played in the procession dressed as Peaky Blinders. Ironically, our distinctive dress code was born out of this costume. We performed with a band to accompany the carnival procession and made our first serious public appearance.

<p>- Folk music concerts: In my short career so far, I have played the most folk music concerts. I have played at various celebrations, weddings, anniversaries and other events. This music brings me profit, which is very convenient for a student enjoying his years :). I have played at many gigs with the ensemble, but mostly with my friend, with whom I have a very well known duo in Cerkno called "Šum".
